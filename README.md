# Purpose

This repo is a research spike on react.js to see if it would be a better fit for
managing components in atomic cms than the atomic assets gem.

## Getting Started

A working ruby installation is needed to execute `server.rb` so comments can be
added and retrieved from `comments.json`.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/samcdavid/research-react.git && cd ./research-react
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
